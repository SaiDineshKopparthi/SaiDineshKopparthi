                        <p>I am a recent Master's graduate in Applied Computer Science from Northwest Missouri State University with an unending enthusiasm for learning new technologies.
                            During my Master's program, I worked as a Graduate Assistant for the iOS Mobile Computing course, which provided me the opportunity to develop several iOS applications using Swift.
                            Additionally, I have professional experience as an Assistant System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services in Hyderabad, India.</p>
                        <p>I love keeping myself busy with developing new types of websites every chance I get.
                            With a particular fondness for JavaScript, I use React, Express.js, and Node.js for web development.
                            In my free time, I enjoy going to gym üèãüèΩ and watching Formula One üèéÔ∏è.</p>
